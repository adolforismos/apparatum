# Mechanisms, Behaviors, Functions and Concepts

## We want to understand what is behind of everything, machines, humans, processes and ideas, and the interaccions between them.

## We believe in concepts as instruments to understand reality, and when reality changes, we believe in the invention of new concepts.

## We want to learn and understand how to use, grow, reinvent,

## How does this work? How do you explain that behavior? How do you define this? What is the function of that?
